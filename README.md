# libcod

**This extension ...**
- provides interoperability between the Call of Duty&reg; 2 server and other software components and/or advanced game modifications (so-called "mods")
- intends to improve the overall game experience and security as the extended software (Call of Duty&reg; 2) is not maintained anymore since more than a decade
- has its focus on the Linux variant of Call of Duty&reg; 2 Multiplayer in version 1.3, other versions are not fully supported (unless the respective offsets/structs are added)
- was implemented for non-profit and educational purposes

## Building and supported platforms
- gcc (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0 (with Speex)
- gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1
- gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0
- gcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0 (with Speex)
> [!NOTE]
> This list is not exhaustive and newer versions might work as well.

### Requirements / Dependencies
- gcc and g++ (with multilib on 64-bit x86 operating systems)
- libstdc++5
- MySQL client (if required by functionality)
- Speex 1.1.9 (can be disabled in [config.hpp](code/config.hpp))

**Base requirements installation (for 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)**
```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libstdc++5:i386
```

**MySQL requirements installation (for 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)**
```
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev:i386
```

**MySQL requirements installation (for 64-bit Debian 11.6)**
```
sudo apt install libmariadb-dev-compat:i386
```

**Sound alias duration support requirements installation**
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
If not installed, `getSoundDuration(<aliasname>)` always returns undefined.

**Custom sound file docs (for 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)**
- [Speex installation](doc/install_speex.md)
- [Audio file conversion](doc/convert_audio_files.md)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: This feature is enabled by default and increases RAM usage by about 500 MB. See below for how to disable it (`nospeex`).

**Creating the binary (written to `./code/bin`)**
```
cd code
./doit.sh

# Or without Speex
./doit.sh nospeex
```

### Historical background

Back in late 2019, we at \*.ZK.\* (a gaming community that shaped itself within the zombie server scene, starting in 2010) ran into some rcon-related limitations with the libcod implementations available at that time. Therefore we decided to take a closer look at the inner workings of this extension (specifically, damage99's version listed above).
Another limitation that bothered us was that, after a few months, we intended to switch our servers to another fs_game folder, but then were about to lose client-sided access to player-account-related configuration data (i.e., a config file containing the logon token for authentication purposes against our servers), due to restricted directory traversal abilities on the client side (which are, after all, a good thing). When looking for a solution we even considered to implement a hard-coded exploit that would move said config during the account migration process. However, we eventually found and used another approach, implemented in pure game code (gsc + menu files) so that it would work without libcod as well.
We then started to add more and more functions to our fork, and especially since late 2021 we're adding (and usually also documenting) whatever feels necessary to help us implementing new features and/or mods.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Release notes before version 10.0 were aligned with other (private) \*.ZK.\* repositories, therefore these notes do not necessarily reflect what was new in *this* repository.
> - The script API might change between major releases, documented [here](doc/changed_script_functions.md)
> - Use this extension at your own risk (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)). Some features are considered highly experimental and might not be stable enough for productive use.
