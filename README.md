# ${\textsf{\color{red}lib\color{green}cod\color{blue}2}\ }$

**This extension ...**
- provides interoperability between the Call of Duty&reg; 2 server and other software components and/or advanced game modifications (so-called "mods"),
- intends to improve the overall game experience and security as the extended software (Call of Duty&reg; 2) is not maintained anymore since more than a decade,
- has its focus on the Linux variant of Call of Duty&reg; 2 Multiplayer and can be used with the original game binary,
- and was implemented for non-profit and educational purposes.

It requires the [server binary](cod2_lnxded) and .iwd files for game version 1.3 to be used as basis and **supports all four game protocol versions** (check out the `sv_version` and proxy dvars), including the ability to let players from all those versions to connect to the same server. All features in this extension work with the original (stock) client executables.
